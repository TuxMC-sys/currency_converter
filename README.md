This is a program for converting currency. It uses the [OER](openexchangerates.org) API with a user provided API key.
The first time you run it, you must load/re-load your currencies. After that, you can do so as needed.
Due to some quirks in my input handling, it may not work on Windows. Commits welcome, especially fixing error handling/input.
